    <p class="canvas-text">
      The BFG9000 appears as a large, futuristic, solid metal gun which fires
      large balls of green plasma. It is the highest damaging weapon in the
      game. The BFG first appears in a secret area of E3M3: Pandemonium in the
      original Doom Game. When picked up, the message "You got the BFG9000! Oh
      yes." appears. The initials composing the weapon's name stand for "Big
      Fucking Gun", or "Bio Force Gun", as it is known as in the 2005 movie.

    <h1 class="canvas-header">The Projectile</h1>
    <p class="canvas-text">
      Roughly one second after firing the BFG, a large green ball of plasma will
      be fired from it. This projectile travels fairly slowly and detonates
      against the first thing it hits. Despite the large animation that plays
      when it hits something, this plasma ball can only ever deal damage to a
      single enemy, the enemy the projectile hits. The actual damage dealt is a
      multiple of 100 randomly chosen between 100 and 800 inclusive (so 100
      damage, 200 damage, etc.).

        For reference, here is a list of all of the hit points monsters have,
        ordered from lowest to highest:

      As you can see, while the BFG projectile by itself has a chance to kill
      most enemies in one hit, it also has a chance to do very little damage
      that all but the weakest of enemies can survive. In fact, a direct hit
      from a rocket deals 148-288 damage to most enemies (the Spider Mastermind
      and Cyberdemon are immune to splash damage from rockets), so sometimes the
      BFG's plasma ball will deal less damage than a rocket!

    <h1 class="canvas-header">The Aftershock</h1>
    <p class="canvas-text">
      The most dangerous and least intuitive part of the BFG is the aftershock
      damage. This damage occurs almost half a second after the projectile hits
      something (if the projectile never hits anything because it flies away
      into the sky box, then this damage will never occur). The actual
      aftershock damage is emitted from where the player is standing in a cone
      shape. The direction this cone is emitted is in the direction the
      projectile was fired at. This is important. Note that this is not the
      direction the player is looking in. It is also not aimed towards where the
      projectile detonated. If you, for example, fired a BFG ball towards the
      South according to the automap, then the cone of aftershock damage will
      fire to the South from the player's current position. If this is tricky to
      understand, then the following image may make it easier:
    </p>

    <img
      src="../assets/images/bgf-stats.png"
      class="img-bfg-stats"
      alt="bfg-stats"
    />
    <p class="canvas-text">
      This means that the aftershock damage may not actually happen anywhere
      near where the BFG ball exploded, particularly if you fired it at a target
      that's far away. If a player assumes the BFG acts like a rocket, you might
      see them fire it at a distant group of enemies and then run away and hide.
      What usually happens in this case is that the aftershock damage doesn't
      hit anything and the shot only dealt the small amount of damage that comes
      from the projectile to a single enemy. This is exactly the wrong way to go
      about maximising use of the BFG. In practice, the BFG acts more like a
      super-powered shotgun.
    </p>
    <p class="canvas-text">
      So how much aftershock damage is dealt? The cone of damage is made up of
      40 "hitscan" shots, each dealing between 49-87 points of damage. The cone
      is roughly 45 degrees wide. There is also a range limit to these shots but
      it's pretty large (1024 map units, for reference 32 map units is the size
      of the player's hitbox and the size of a typical teleporter platform). The
      theoretical maximum damage caused by the aftershock damage is therefore
      3480, much much higher than the projectile. In practice, the total of the
      projectile and aftershock damage will deal a bit less than 3000 points of
      damage to a nearby and tightly clustered group of enemies.
